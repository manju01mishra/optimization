Explanation of the Code: Profit Maximization using Linear Programming (LP)

This Python code uses the PuLP library to solve a Linear Programming problem for profit maximization. It aims to find the optimal production quantities of two products, Product A and Product B, while considering constraints on machine hours and labor hours. The objective is to maximize profit.



1. Importing Necessary Libraries

from pulp import LpMaximize, LpProblem, LpVariable, value

LpMaximize: Specifies that the problem is a maximization problem.

LpProblem: Defines the LP problem (i.e., an optimization problem).

LpVariable: Used to create the decision variables for the problem.

value: Extracts the value of the objective function after solving the problem.

2. Defining the LP Model

model = LpProblem(name="profit-maximization", sense=LpMaximize)

A linear programming model is created with the name profit-maximization.

The sense of the problem is set to maximize (indicating a profit maximization problem).


3. Defining the Decision Variables

A = LpVariable(name="Product_A", lowBound=0, cat="Continuous")
B = LpVariable(name="Product_B", lowBound=0, cat="Continuous")

A and B are the decision variables representing the number of units of Product A and Product B to be produced.

Both variables are restricted to be non-negative (lowBound=0) and are continuous (i.e., they can take any real value).



4. Defining the Objective Function

model += 40 * A + 50 * B, "Total_Profit"

The objective is to maximize profit, where:

Product A contributes $40 per unit.

Product B contributes $50 per unit.


The objective function is 40A + 50B, and is added to the model.



5. Defining the Constraints

Machine Hours Constraint
model += 2 * A + 4 * B <= 40, "Machine_Hours_Constraint"
The total machine hours required for production cannot exceed 40.
Product A requires 2 machine hours per unit, and Product B requires 4 machine hours per unit.

The constraint is:
2A + 4B \leq 40
Labor Hours Constraint
model += 3 * A + 2 * B <= 30, "Labor_Hours_Constraint"
The total labor hours available are 30.
Product A requires 3 labor hours per unit, and Product B requires 2 labor hours per unit.
The constraint is:
3A + 2B \leq 30


6. Solving the LP Problem
model.solve()
This line uses the PuLP solver to solve the LP problem. It finds the optimal values of A and B that maximize the profit while satisfying all the constraints.


7. Printing the Results

print(f"Optimal production of Product A: {A.varValue} units")
print(f"Optimal production of Product B: {B.varValue} units")
print(f"Maximum Profit: ${value(model.objective)}")

After solving the problem, the optimal values of A and B are printed. These values represent the optimal production quantities of Product A and Product B.

The maximum profit is calculated by evaluating the objective function at the optimal values of A and B.



Final Output Example:

The program will output something like:

Optimal production of Product A: 4.0 units
Optimal production of Product B: 5.0 units
Maximum Profit: $370.0

This means the optimal solution is to produce 4 units of Product A and 5 units of Product B for a total maximum profit of $370.

Summary of the Problem:

Objective: Maximize profit.

Decision Variables: Quantity of Product A (A) and Product B (B).

Objective Function: Profit = 40A + 50B.

Constraints:

Machine hours: 2A + 4B ≤ 40.

Labor hours: 3A + 2B ≤ 30.


Solution: Finds the optimal production quantities of Product A and Product B to maximize profit.
